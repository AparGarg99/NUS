Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump debated on national security issues. Their differences were especially clear when discussing Russia and combating ISIS. Clinton has slammed Trump repeatedly for admiring Russian President Vladimir Putin with Trump, again on NBC News, praising Putin in comparison to US President Barack Obama. 
Trump has said he would confer with US generals on his ISIS plan though he also said that Pentagon generals have not stood up to Obama. "I think under the leadership Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble."
Clinton, when asked about her previously hawkish foreign policy record, said, "We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again and we are not putting ground troops into Syria."
